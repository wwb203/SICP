if the interpreter is applicative-order, it will return 0.
Otherwise the interpreter will enter an infinite loop of repleacing (p) with (p)

From google, (newif (good-enough? guess x) guess (sqrt-iter)) is a procedure
lisp will evaluate all operands including (sqrt-iter) before new-if is
applied, which causes infinite loop. In contrast, the primitive if evaluate
(good-enough? guess x) first before execute guess or (sqrt-iter),
lisp will evaluate all operands including (srt-iter)
